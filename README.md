# Phone webstore built up with React(react-dom, react-router; redux, redux-thunk; ramda)

1. Displays item's(phones) cards with short info and two buttons ("more info", "add to cart"), shopping cart, list of brands to sort from, quick shop search input, "load more" button
2. Each item card has its own page with full discription and data array using backend list of ids, categories, descriptions, etc.
3. You can add items to cart, delete items from cart, see each and total prices
4. List of brands allows to sort out items by categories using unique ids
5. "Load more" button shows up more items from mocking list
6. Flexible design

## What else could be done:
1. Search input accepts any upper\lower case typing
2. Shopping cart button need a little fix (not flexible enough)

Thank you!
